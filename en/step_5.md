## Challenges

- Can you transition from one colour to the next rather than instantly change?
- Can you light up one pixel at a time (in order or at random) by using `set_pixels` instead of clear?
- Can you add support for more colour representations like RGB or hex?
- Can you add support for keywords like "rainbow" which perform a cycle of colours rather than a single colour?
